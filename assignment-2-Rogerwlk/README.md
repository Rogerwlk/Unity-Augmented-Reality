### Work Summary:

Look at all the possible documents and tutorials and ask TA for help. The starting is diffcult. I make slow progress in question 1 and 2. After finishing question2, I quickly finish the rest. I can only run the program on my computer not on my OnePlus5T phone with Android 8. I tried to update Vuforia and checked the box for finding ground plane. I will give up using Vuforia for group project. I have a better sense of how Unity works overall.
