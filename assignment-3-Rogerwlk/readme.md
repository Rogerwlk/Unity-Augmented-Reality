### Part 1
Insert your answers to the questions below

### Google Earth VR Questions

1. Where did you go and why?

I went to my hometown in Nanjing China, my undergraduate school Georgetown University in Washington DC, and Cornell Tech! I want to compare the VR experience with the realistic experience.

2. Did you feel ‘present’ in those locations? Why or why not?

I didn't feel 'present' in my hometown, because there is no high resolution data and street view data about my hometown. I can only see the satellite image from a far away distance. I feel like I am riding a static hot air balloon looking down from the sky. Google hasn't collected map data on the ground in my hometown and their satellite image can't compare with military grade image.

I feel 'present' in Georgetown University and Cornell Tech in the street view mode. The photo is clear and I can move around with certain freedom. A small problem is that these photos are not taken at the same time, so it is wierd to see the same group of people at different places.

3. Did you feel motion sickness while exploring the world? If so, what do you think caused that feeling?

Yes. I feel motion sickness when I am using VR all the time. I can't even play 3D first person perspective games. There are many possible reasons. The light is not natural and maybe a little bit too strong, so it makes me feel dizzy. Two eyes should see slightly different image, but the screen shows the same image. The image resolution is not as good as reality, I can see lots of tiny black dots.

4. Do you consider the UI/UX in Google Earth VR to be intuitive? Why or why not?

Yes. There is a good tutorial telling you how to use it. I can always see the usage information on my controller if I forget the usage. The number of operations is limited, so it is not hard to understand.


### Rec Room Questions

1. Did you feel connected to your avatar after customizing them? Why or why not?

No. I can only see my hands. I should be able to see my arms and bodies.

2. When socializing with others, did it feel as if you were connecting with them on the same level as if you were in the same physical space? Why or why not?

Yes. I can wave my hands and hear others talking. The movement is constrained and not flexible in the VR, but socializing with simple hand movements is already amazing.

3. Do you consider the UI/UX in Rec Room to be intuitive? Why or why not?

Yes. Swipe trackpad to rotate. Hold trackpad to teleport. It is not easy to type in VR but I can figure out what to do without detailed explanations. There is also a good tutorial teaching you some basic operations. If I can move more freely in the space without limitation of reality. It would feel better.

### Work Summary:

Finished all and bonus 1 & 3. Bonus 2 was too hard. I couldn't find a way to clear models from the model browser and load new objects. Every time when I loaded objects, I loaded the same set of objects in the same order. I couldn't load objects randomly. To complete bonus 2 may need to change lots of code in poly script. A naive implementation will be loading more objects than necessary and randomly select some to display. Reset the scene everytime to clear every models from the model browser. This implementation was not good enough and always broke my program, so I didn't do it.
