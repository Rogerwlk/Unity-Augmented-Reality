### Work Summary:

Spend lots of time. I can't figure out how to make every object interactable in the Super Mode. I can move the object's mesh collider, but the object is not moved. Objects also keep falling out of the scene.

### Super Mode Implementation:

I add a button to listen to background music and stop listening. I also add a button to remove or add gravity.
